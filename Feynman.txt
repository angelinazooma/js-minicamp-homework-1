** Variables

variables are a way to store bits of data to be used in your 
program. You give your variable a name and then apply a value 
to that variable.


** Strings

a bunch of characters 'strung' together. Can be alphanumeric



** Functions (arguments, `return`)

a block of code which can be run as many times as you want. 
This block of code is defined as a function and is contained 
within curly braces. Variables which are used in this function 
need to be defined when declaring it (passed in as an arguement 
within the brackets). If you want to use the results of this 
function as a variable you need to 'return' the results.


** `if` statements

evaulates whether an operation evalues as true or false. 
Actions can then be taken depending on which response is given.


** Boolean values (`true`, `false`)

true or false, yes or no, one or zero.
